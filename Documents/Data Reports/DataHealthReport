# Data Health Report
The minimum checks to be conducted for each dataset include: 
1. Number of records
2. Number of attributes (or features)
3. Attribute data types (nominal, ordinal, or interval)
4. Number of missing values
5. Inconsistent data records
6. Check the range of values allowed per attribute (e.g., GPA = 10.0)
7. Column or line separators always separate columns and lines appropriately

Recommendations: 
- Frequency distribution report for nominal and ordinal data
- Analysis of the Mean/Min/Max/Std Dev for interval or continuous data
