# Baseline Model Report

_Train a baseline model to quickly evaluate the feature set identified for machine learning. Through this exercise, we can conduct an assessment of the feasibility of the machine learning task._

Research reporting capabilities for RapidMiner. Information we are seeking from this baseline report is outlined below.  

## Analytic Approach
* What is target definition
* What are inputs (description)
* What kind of model was built?

## Model Description
* Models and Parameters
* Description or images of data flow and scoring workflow 

## Results (Model Performance)
* ROC/Lift charts, AUC, R^2, MAPE as appropriate

## Model Understanding
* Variable Importance (significance)
* Insights Derived from the Model


## Conclusion and Discussions for Next Steps
* Conclusion on Feasibility Assessment of the Machine Learning Task
* Discussion on Overfitting (If Applicable)
* New features to consider and/or create 
* Other data sources to include to improve modeling
