# Project-Folder-Structure

A standardized structure is in place for Insights and data science projects. A shared directory and use of standard templates will make it easy for team members to find information related to a project, as well as, make it easier for team members to understand the work completed by others. All documents and code are stored in a Github to enable team collaboration. Tasks are tracked in Jira to allow for tracking and to provide visibility to project status and completion. A separate repository should be created for each project on Github. The standardized structure for all projects will help build institutional knowledge across the team and facilitate team member on-boarding.
