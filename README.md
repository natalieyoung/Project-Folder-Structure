# Project-Folder-Structure

A standardized structure is in place for Insights and data science projects. A shared directory and use of standard templates will make it easy for team members to find information related to a project, as well as, make it easier for team members to understand the work completed by others. All documents and code are stored in a Github to enable team collaboration. Tasks are tracked in Jira to allow for tracking and to provide visibility to project status and completion. A separate repository should be created for each project on Github. The standardized structure for all projects will help build institutional knowledge across the team and facilitate team member on-boarding.

### Project Folders

**Main Folder: Project Name (Main Folder)**

* Sub-Folder 1: Documents
* Sub Folder 2: Sample Data
* Sub-Folder 3: Code


### Naming Conventions for Documents

**Document Name: YYYYMMDD_Project ID_Document_v(n)**

* YYYYMMDD: Allow for easy searching and sorting based on date
* Project ID: Need to determine how we will assign a Project ID (perhaps Jira Epic Number)
* Document: Document Name or Title
* Version: v1, v2, v3 for drafts; vf for final
